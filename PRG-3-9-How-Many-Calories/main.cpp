//  A bag of cookies holds 30 cookies. The calorie infornation on the bag claims there are
//  10 "servings" in the bag and that a serving equals 300 calories. Write a program that
//  asks the user to input how many cookies he or she actually ate, then reports how many
//  total calories were consumed.
